This is for the Arduino / Motion board code that will generate motion information and publish it via a serial interface. 

I am using a pro micro board, in order go get support for it, copy-paste this URL:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/master/IDE_Board_Manager/package_sparkfun_index.json

into File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs

and then go to Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager, scroll to the bottom, and install the "SparkFun AVR Boards" that includes the pro micro in the description. Restart Arduino IDE for the changes to take effect.
